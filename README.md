(v) Economic impact: The software industry is one of the largest and most influential sectors of the global economy. Software engineering plays a critical role in driving economic growth and creating jobs.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
(i) The Software Crisis (1960s-1970s):
As software systems became larger and more complex, it became increasingly difficult to manage their development and ensure their quality. This led to the "software crisis," characterized by late delivery, cost overruns, and unreliable software. It has also impact that the software crisis prompted the development of formal methodologies and engineering principles to address these challenges.
(ii) The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (1980s-1990s):
 Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm where software is organized around objects, which encapsulate data and the operations that can be performed on that data. Its impact has led OOP led to more modular, reusable, and maintainable software. Languages like C++, Java, and Python, which heavily influenced OOP, became widely adopted.
(iii) Agile Development (Late 1990s-Early 2000s):
The agile development methodologies, emphasize iterative development, customer collaboration, and flexible planning. It's impact has led agile practices helped address the limitations of traditional waterfall methodologies, which often resulted in inflexible development processes and delayed delivery hence agile have become increasingly popular in the software industry, particularly for projects with rapidly changing requirements.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts or instructions to guide an AI model's response. It's to asking a question in a way that elicits the desired information or outcome.
Importance of Prompt Engineering:
 -Targeted Responses: Well-constructed prompts can significantly influence the relevance and quality of an AI's output. A clear and specific prompt will likely yield a more accurate and pertinent response.
 -Model Control: Prompt engineering allows users to steer the direction of the AI's conversation, ensuring it stays on topic and avoids unintended biases.
 -Creativity and Innovation: By experimenting with different prompt formats, users can encourage AI models to generate creative and novel ideas.
 -Task Completion: Effective prompts can help AI models perform various tasks, such as writing code, translating languages, or summarizing information.
 -Bias Mitigation: Careful prompt design can help mitigate biases that may be present in the AI model or its training data.
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
This prompt is vague because it's too broad and doesn't specify what aspect of AI the user is interested in. It could lead to a response that is overly general or irrelevant to the user's specific needs.
Improved Prompt: This improved prompt is clear, specific, and concise. It focuses on a particular topic within the field of AI and asks a direct question. By providing a clear and specific focus, the prompt ensures that the response will be relevant and informative to the user.
Why the improved prompt is more effective:
Specificity: The improved prompt narrows down the topic to a specific aspect of AI, ensuring that the response is tailored to the user's interest.
Directness: The question format is direct and straightforward, making it easier for the AI to understand the user's intent.
Conciseness: The prompt is concise, avoiding unnecessary words or phrases that could confuse the AI or lead to irrelevant information.
